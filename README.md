# Store Inventory Tracking Application

The Store Inventory Tracking application will track the total number of products there are in the store. 
More specifically, it will keep track of a *product's name*, how many *units of a given product were ordered* 
by the store, how many *units are still available to be sold*, and how many *units were already sold*. The application will also allow store managers 
and inventory specialists to see which *products are about to be, or already are, out of stock* 
and the *cost to restock* products to full capacity.
